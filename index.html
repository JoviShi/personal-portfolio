        <p>
        Never stop learning because it's a never ending voyage!  
        </p>
        <p> 

        As an open-minded IT professional, I‚Äôm developing my career by constantly sharpening my technical knowledge, skills, and troubleshooting abilities in computer hardware, software, and networking. I am CompTIA A+ certified and have completed the Cisco NetAcademy IT Essentials. I'm currently learning software development fundamentals and have obtained a MTA certification.
      </p>
      <p>

        My super power is my strong work ethic paired with my adaptable background in customer service, teaching, and traveling. Over the past couple years, I have taught and traveled in Asia where I was embraced by 4 vibrant cultures. Solo traveling has tested my resourcefulness, organizational skills, optimistic attitude, and has molded me into a better-rounded individual. Not only do I have confidence in my ability to get things done, but I also possess qualities that make me an approachable leader and a great team player. I believe in accountability so you can count on me like 1, 2, 3!
